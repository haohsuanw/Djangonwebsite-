>What's the overall purpose?
>>This is a website to introduce a company whose main idea is connecting
with artists and the suppliers to create an idea such as commodities or
exhibitions for clients. Moreover, this idea is why I called this website
enzyme office, we hope we can increase the value of art and business.
Also, people can come to this website to write their comments about this
work and talk about their feeling. Since we believe different voices can
create better works. This website is also an art experiment to see when
artists' works are judged by the public and the different thoughts between
artists and the public.
<br />

>Who are the intended users?
>>People at the age of 12-70 and love to go to art exhibitions or art galleries.
People before 12 may not clearly understand what art is and know-how to
critically thinking. Also, the child may hard to present their idea or give a
review of artwork, since children do not finish their basic education. On the
other hand, most of the people after 70 may not use the internet and they
can not access this website easily. Thus, our target audience will be from
12-70.
Moreover, people who love to go to art exhibitions or art gallery can give
us more discussion since they have more sense of art.
And they are also our targeted audiences.
